Boilerplate code for a React + D3 visualization with:

- CDN links for React, ReactDOM, and D3
- Basic React boilerplate
- Variables for dimensions and margins
- A `VizContainer` component that:
  - Abstracts SVG/group container elements
  - Follows the margin convention
  - Show the margins, which can be easily removed by deleting the `showMargins={true} prop`
